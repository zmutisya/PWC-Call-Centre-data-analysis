### The Overview
This is a part of my virtual case experience on pwc call centre trends analysis offered by forage. Here I used some useful insights like - total call answered/rejected, calls duration, calls resolved/unresolved, agents statistics, customer satisfaction, used slicers, cards, charts and used data cleansing, Dax function, added new measures & columns.
