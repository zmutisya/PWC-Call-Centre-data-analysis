### The Overview
This is a part of my virtual case experience on pwc call centre trends analysis offered by forage. Here I used some useful insights like - total call answered/rejected, calls duration, calls resolved/unresolved, agents statistics, customer satisfaction, used slicers, cards, charts and used data cleansing, Dax function, added new measures & columns. The dataset has 5001 rows and the following 10 columns
* Call Id
* Agent
* Date
* Time
* Topic
* Answered (Y/N)
* Resolved
* Speed of answer in seconds
* Avg Talk Duration
* Satisfaction rating
